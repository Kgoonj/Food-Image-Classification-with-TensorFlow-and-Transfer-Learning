# üñºÔ∏è Image Classification with CNNs

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for performing image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The notebook walks through the process of loading image data, building a CNN model, training it, and evaluating its performance.

## üìò Project Overview

The notebook `Image_Classification (2).ipynb` demonstrates a full deep learning workflow using a popular image dataset (e.g., CIFAR-10, MNIST, or custom). It includes:

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Model architecture definition (using Keras/TensorFlow)
- Model training and evaluation
- Accuracy and loss visualization
- (Optional) Prediction on new/unseen images

## üõ† Technologies Used

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- (Optional) OpenCV or PIL for image processing

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Image_Classification.git
cd Image_Classification
2. Install dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook

üß† Model Architecture
The CNN architecture typically includes:

Convolutional layers with ReLU activation

MaxPooling layers

Dropout for regularization

Fully connected (Dense) layers

Softmax output for classification

You can easily modify the architecture to fit your dataset or complexity needs.

üìä Evaluation
During and after training, the notebook provides:

Accuracy and loss curves (training vs. validation)

Confusion matrix (if applicable)

Classification performance metrics
